I just released the first alpha version of a new filter to embed Picasa Webalbum Slideshows into any page which accepts input filters in Drupal 7. Swing by and try it out at the [project page](http://drupal.org/project/picasa_slideshow_filter).

The module was developed to use at [Vejle Idrætshøjskole's website](http://vih.dk/).
