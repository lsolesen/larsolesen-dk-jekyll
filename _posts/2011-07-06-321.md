I used to get a lot of spam on this site. They were not shown because I had comments approval turned on for anonymous users. However, it was tedious to figure out whether there were any real comments in between. Lately, I have been writing some Drupal-oriented articles which ended up on Planet Drupal, and as a result traffic and the number of useful comments have risen. I needed a new approach.

First I installed the [antispam module](http://drupal.org/project/antispam), but it seemed unfinished, so I choose [mollom](http://drupal.org/project/mollom) instead, and I have not had one single spam comment since. It was a breeze to install, and now I just skip the comment approval for anonymous users and that makes a better user experience for everybody. You can set the permission to skip comment approval on _admin/people/permissions._

How do you handle spam on your Drupal site?
