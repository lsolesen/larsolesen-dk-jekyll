When getting a completely new Windows 7 computer, you will probably want some programs on it. You probably need an e-mail program, an officie suite, some security, some cloud storage and some media stuff.

Enter ninite.com

Start by going to the _free_ [ninite.com](https://ninite.com). Here you will get the possibility to choose from a long list of Windows programs. Choose the ones you want and start installing.
