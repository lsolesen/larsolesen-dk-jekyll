Nowadays, I almost only use Google Docs for my text processing needs. I needed to do a mail merge using data from a Google Docs Spreadsheet to a Google Docs Document.

After a lot of Googling, I found [How do I mail merge from Google Spreadsheet to a Google Document?](http://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/40067/how-do-i-mail-merge-from-google-spreadsheet-to-a-google-document)

I could not get the script to work by copying it into Google Docs. However, there was a link where I could invoke the script - and[clicking merge documents](https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbwESJDw_pKQ3xFd5fofw02P-CD13f9TmiSeXhlkJ2dj1mEw09km/exec) will get you to a good result.
