It is fairly easy to use one Drupal 7 code base for several sites. However, you need one database for each site, so you cannot share users across the sites. If you know an easy workaround to share users, please advice in the comments.

### What I did?

I did the installation on a Dreamhost shared server with ssh access.

First, I created one database for each site.

Second, I created the domains. When you create a domain at Dreamhost, it will create a web accessible folder:

`/home/user/larsolesen.dk`

Third, I put the Drupal 7 files into the web accessible folder of the first domain.

Fourth, I created symbolic links so the other web accessible folders knows where to find the installation. The symbolic links were created as follows:

`ln -s originalsite.dk anothersite.dk`

Fifth, I created extra site folders in the Drupal 7 folder /sites/. The folders should just be named the domain name, so for instance larsolesen.dk. Underneath that folder I created a settings.php file and af files folder like you would do on a single site install under default.

Now, that is about it for doing a multisite Drupal 7 install on the same codebase with different databases.
