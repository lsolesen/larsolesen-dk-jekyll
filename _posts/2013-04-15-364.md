In [discimport.dk](http://discimport.dk) we are using [Drupal Commerce Kickstart](http://drupal.org/project/commerce_kickstart) and we just recently started using [BillysBilling.dk](http://billysbilling.dk) as our accounting solution. Therefore we just started to code on a Drupal integration between the two systems in a [dedicated module on drupal.org](http://drupal.org/project/billysbilling).

If you want any say in how the module evolves, you are more than welcome to [come to the issue queue](http://drupal.org/project/issues/billysbilling) and express your opinion. I am using the official php-sdk for BIllysBilling, which is available from [github.com](http://github.com/billysbilling/billysbilling-php).

Right now we are thinking about two different integrations:

- **Rules** - create custom actions and events which could pass the objects to the api. I would then need to impleent hook\_rules\_event\_info() and hook\_rules\_action\_info().
- **Implement a hook\_post\_save()** which responds to checkout complete or order save - or maybe even better make a new status on an order after executed, namely invoiced.

What would you do?
