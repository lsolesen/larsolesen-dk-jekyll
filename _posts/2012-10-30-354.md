As I wrote earlier, I am creating a [registration system using Drupal Commerce](http://larsolesen.dk/node/353) for [Vejle Idrætshøjskole](http://vih.dk). For one of our course type, we need the customer to be able to select subjects during the checkout process. We decided to do it on a custom line item using [custom customizable products](http://drupal.org/project/commerce_custom_product) where we added the subjects as a field.

The subjects is not the same on all of our courses on that course type, so I attached the subjects using an entityreference. Using the [entityreference](http://drupal.org/project/entityreference) module under the settings for the field, I can use Views: Filter by an entityreference view to select the entities, I want to show for for the entityreference field on the custom line item on the add to cart form.

However, when using the add to cart form, I could not simply choose the current page node id for the contextual filter for the referenced entities. Instead I had to use a token to make the reference from the currently chosen product to the course display content type with the referenced subjects.

Luckily, that is possible using the [patch from the issue: Dynamic Views Arguments Using Tokens](http://drupal.org/node/1699378). Now I was able via the settings page for the subjects field on the custom line item type to supply an argument for my view using this token: \[commerce-line-item:commerce-product:product-id\].

When I resolved this issue [issue](http://drupal.org/node/1826676) everything worked beautifully. How do you handle registrations with Drupal Commerce?
