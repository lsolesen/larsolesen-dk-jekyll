At [Vejle Idrætshøjskole](http://vih.dk) we invite the community to participate in our some of our lectures. Of course we list the lectures on our [lecture webpage](http://vih.dk/foredrag). The list is easily created using a custom content type and some views.

However, I also wanted to make a version which prints nicely. A pdf is still the best tool to make a layout you can depend on. So I created a layout for my lectures using TCPDF. After a while I grew tired of the layout, and created a new layout still using TCPDF. But in doing so I was thinking: maybe other people could use my layouts, or maybe one day, I will like the old layout again. Therefore I decided that the content administrator should be able to choose between the different layouts I have created.

Enter ctools plugins system
---------------------------

I tried creating the layout utilizing the ctools plugin system. First I needed to make my module aware of the plugins:

```
/**
 * Implements hook_ctools_plugin_type().
 *
 * Has plenty options. See ctools/help/plugins-creating.html
 */
function vih_lectures_pdf_ctools_plugin_type() {
  $plugins['layouts'] = array(
    'use hooks' => TRUE,
  );

  return $plugins;
}


/**
 * Implements hook_ctools_plugin_directory().
 */
function vih_lectures_pdf_ctools_plugin_directory($owner, $plugin) {
  if (($owner == 'vih_lectures_pdf') && ($plugin == 'layouts')) {
    return 'plugins/' . $plugin;
  }
} 
```

Now, the system knows, that I am utilizing the ctools plugin system. Then I put my different layouts into different folders using the same naming convention, so I could use it in my module function. The function can both output one single lecture (a custom content type), but also a collection of lectures (created by an entity reference field on another custom content type).

```
function vih_lectures_pdf_booklet($lecture) {
  require_once libraries_get_path('tcpdf') . '/tcpdf.php';
  global $base_url;
  $events = array();
  $layout = variable_get('vih_lectures_pdf_layout', 'portrait');
  ctools_include('Layout', 'vih_lectures_pdf', 'plugins/layouts/' . $layout);
  $class = 'VIH_Lectures_Pdf_' . ucfirst($layout);

  if ($lecture->type == 'vih_lectures') {
    foreach ($lecture->field_lectures['und'] as $key => $value) {
      $node = node_load($value['target_id']);
      if ($node) {
        $events[] = $node;
      }
    }
  } else {
    $events[] = $lecture;
  }

  $pdf = new $class($events);
  $pdf->setBaseUrl($base_url);
  $pdf->setHeading($lecture->title);
  $pdf->setAuthor(variable_get('site_name', "Vejle Idrætshøjskole"));
  if ($logo = file_load(variable_get('vih_lectures_pdf_logo', ''))) {
    $pdf->setLogo(drupal_realpath($logo->uri));
  }

  if ($lecture->type == 'vih_lectures') {
    $pdf->setSubTitle($lecture->field_subtitle['und'][0]['safe_value']);
    $pdf->setDescription($lecture->body['da'][0]['safe_value']);
    $file = drupal_realpath($lecture->field_picture['da'][0]['uri']);
    $pdf->addFrontpage($file);
    $pdf->addSecondPage($file);
  }

  $pdf->render();
  drupal_exit();
} 
```

You can basically see the rest in the [module file](https://github.com/vih/vih.dk-features/blob/master/vih_lectures_pdf/vih_lectures_pdf.module), which is the glue in the system. There I also created a simple settings pages (which could be hugely improved to look like e.g. the apperance page, so one could see the screenshot of the layout).

You can see the [entire source code for my PDFs for the lectures at github](https://github.com/vih/vih.dk-features/tree/master/vih_lectures_pdf).

How do you create your different layouts when using pdf's without overriding your previous layout on each iteration?
