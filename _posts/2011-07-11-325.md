My beloved HTC Desire died, because it did not wear a bathing suit. I decided to buy a Samsung Galaxy II s as a replacement, because I wanted a nice phone with Android. And it is a lovely phone.

However, I just spend too much time figuring out how to show all my Google Calendars - also the calendars other people share with me. Turned out that I had to show them in my web interface in my browser to be able to find them on my phone.

Samsung developers really need to fix this, as that is just plain strange.
