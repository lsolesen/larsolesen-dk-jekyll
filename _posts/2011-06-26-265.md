I am porting a legacy website to Drupal 7. The old website has a lot of functionality, and it works fairly well already, and it is written in [konstrukt framework](http://konstrukt.dk) (which I really enjoy using). However, I want to leverage the CMS power of Drupal 7. Eventually I want to convert the entire site to Drupal, but time is limited at the moment (isn't it always). Therefore I wanted to embed my legacy application into Drupal 7.

It should not be to hard (even though I still got some [open issues](http://github.com/lsolesen/konstrukt-drupal/issues)). However, the showstopper at the moment are clashing free floating global functions, e.g. _t()_ and _url()_. Since I do not want to replace the functions in my entire legacy application, it seems that I am not able to embed the application as I was hoping for.

[Dynamic global functions in PHP](http://blogs.sitepoint.com/dynamic-global-functions-in-php/) would be great. Would you do that for me and the community Drupal? It is only a few lines of code!
