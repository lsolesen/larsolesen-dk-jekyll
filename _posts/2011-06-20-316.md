We [recently switched to Drupal for vih.dk](http://larsolesen.dk/node/270) and a lot of pages has been moved around and given new names. We do not want to create a mapping from the old links to the new links. Instead we wanted to remove the old links from Google.

The problem
-----------

We were faced with one problem though. Even though the path did not exist anymore, it was still accepted but a different page was shown. This legacy url:

`<span style="display: none;"> </span>http://vih.dk/langekurser/fag/28<span style="display: none;"> </span>`automatically pointed to:

`<span style="display: none;"> </span>http://vih.dk/langekurser<span style="display: none;"> </span>`Thus still giving a http response code 200 to Google.

Pages to the rescue
-------------------

Page Manager from Ctools could help making some 404's for custom paths. All we needed to do was adding a new page with the path I wanted to remove from Google, e.g.

`http://vih.dk/langekurser/fag/%fag`And then add the response code 404 for that path. It works like a charm.

How would you solve this situation?
