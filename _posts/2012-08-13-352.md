I have created an installation profile for most of my sites, which I use when creating new platforms on my Barracuda-Octopus-Aegir setup. When creating new platforms I only utilize the make-files, which pretty much leaves the installation profile untested - until a second developer joins the project.

Therefore I looked into a way of getting my changes tested. All my sites are on github.com, and thus I could utilize Travis CI-integration. Turned out that it was not to difficult. I simply enabled Travis CI for the project and added the following .travis.yml to the root of my Drupal 7-installation profile.

  
```
<pre type="yaml">language: php

php:
  - 5.3

mysql:
  database: drupal
  username: root
  encoding: utf8
  
before_script:
  - "mysql -e 'create database drupal;'"
  - pear channel-discover pear.drush.org
  - pear install drush/drush
  - phpenv rehash
  - drush make vih_dk.build ../vih.dk
  - cd ../vih.dk
  - sudo chmod -R 777 sites/all/modules
  - drush si vih_dk --db-url=mysql://root:@127.0.0.1/drupal --account-name=admin --account-pass=VIH@2012 --site-mail=admin@example.com --site-name="vih.dk" --yes
  - drush cc all --yes

script: 
  - test -d profiles/vih_dk
  - test -d profiles/vih_dk/modules/contrib
  - test -d profiles/vih_dk/modules/vih
  - test -d profiles/vih_dk/themes
```


To see the results, see the [build status on Travis](http://travis-ci.org/#!/vih/vih.dk-deploy), and you can even implement a little image on you website telling whether your installation profile builds correctly.

E.g. the build status for the installation profile for vih.dk:

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/vih/vih.dk-deploy.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/vih/vih.dk-deploy)

### More to test

There is probably more that you could test automatically. What are you including in your tests?
