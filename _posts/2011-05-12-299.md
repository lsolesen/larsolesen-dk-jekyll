I just promoted my very first Drupal module from the sandbox to a real project and released version 7.x-1.0 of the input filter to include Scribd documents into the Drupal content. Swing by and try it out at the [project page](http://drupal.org/project/scribd_filter).

It was a rather long process because there are so many new suggestions for modules. The module was developed to use at [Vejle Idrætshøjskole's website](http://vih.dk).
