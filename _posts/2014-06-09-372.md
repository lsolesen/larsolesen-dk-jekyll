I will try to help out in the [Drupal Commons](http://drupal.org/project/commons) issue queue for the 7.x-3.x version on Thursday. Come and join me. The main objective of the bug triage is to narrow down the bug count and maybe fix some low-hanging fruit in the issue queue, so it will be easier for the main developers to get stuff done and focus on the most important stuff.

### Timeframe

On Thursday from 10.30 CEST til around 14.30 CEST I will be working an online in #drupal-commons.

### Want to join?

Everybody can join. We will just meet up in the IRC channel for #drupal-commons. You can join at any time during that period.

There is plenty to do for people at different skill levels.

[Sign up for the online event here](https://groups.drupal.org/node/426733).

### Updates for the efforts

Updates for our efforts will be posted on this page.
