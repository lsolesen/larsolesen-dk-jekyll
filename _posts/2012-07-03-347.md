I have been using [colorbox](http://drupal.org/project/colorbox) on several projects, and we are [thinking about making the colorbox module a dependency](http://drupal.org/node/1053674) of [Media Gallery](http://drupal.org/project/media_gallery). One day I had an issue which I could not figure out, so I went to the [issue queue](http://drupal.org/project/issues/colorbox?categories=All) to see whether other had the same problem as me. Luckily they had, so my issue was quickly resolved.

However, I took a look at the frontpage and saw that there was more than 260 open issues. There are to branches 6.x and 7.x, but for a relatively simple module, that is a lot. So I started digging through issues to see whether some of them could be closed. I found duplicates, answered support questions and asked for more info, to make it easier to answer the questions.

The maintainer, [frjo](http://drupal.org/user/5546), appreciated my efforts and he quickly closed some issues as well. That meant that we could close and mark a lot of issues as 'fixed'. Right now there are 209 open issues, and a lot of '[fixed](http://drupal.org/project/issues/colorbox?text=&status=2&priorities=All&categories=All&version=All&component=All)' issues. That, off course, makes the maintainer's life easier.

There are 78,043 other people using the module also. Have an hour to help out?

7,985 potential 6.x co-maintainers
----------------------------------

The project is looking for a co-maintainer for the 6.x-branch. Hopefully someone will step up and dig into the [issue queue for the 6.x-issues](http://drupal.org/project/issues/colorbox?text=&status=Open&priorities=All&categories=All&version=6.x&component=All). A good place to start is by [reviewing patches](http://drupal.org/project/issues/colorbox?text=&status=8&priorities=All&categories=All&version=6.x&component=All) and answering [support requests](http://drupal.org/project/issues/colorbox?text=&status=Open&priorities=All&categories=support&version=6.x&component=All).

**If you are using colorbox, help out to make the module even better.**
