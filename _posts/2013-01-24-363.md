I needed to embed some Google Drive Presentations into some of my articles. However, I did not want to give the users full HTML access. Therefore, I created an input filter. I added the [code to a sandbox on drupal.org](https://drupal.org/sandbox/lsolesen/1897984).

This module provides an input filter to add a document from Gogle Drive anywhere input filters are accepted. You can choose to embed the document or link to the published document on Google Drive.

Read more about Google Drive on docs.google.com.

To add a document from Google Drive to a textarea, simply add the following code to your textarea

```
<pre class="codeblock">
`[gdoc id=xxxx type=yyyy mode=zzzz]`
```
where id=xxxx is the document\_id from Google Drive, type=yyyy is the type of document and mode=zzzz is the optional display mode.

Do you know of other possible solutions - or do you have any improvements to my implementation?
