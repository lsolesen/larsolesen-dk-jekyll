I've been involved quite a lot lately in helping out with [Panopoly](http://drupal.org/project/panopoly) - and it has just got to a 1.1 release because of great work @dsnopek, @mrfelton and @populist. Panopoly builds heavily on Panels, and I saw that they are getting [close to releasing a 3.4-version](https://drupal.org/node/2177961).

@japerry started to maintain panels, and he is working hard moving Panels forward, so everybody else can benefit from this great module.

However, it is a daunting task. As of writing there is 632 open issues in the [issue queue for panels](https://drupal.org/project/issues/panels?categories=All). You really do not have to be a coder to help sort out the issues. There is a lot of tasks, you can easily do, so @japerry can focus on the important stuff.

[This is what you can do, if you want to be a janitor in the issue queue](http://larsolesen.dk/node/355).
