Registration system for Drupal 7 using Commerce I needed a registration system for the Danish Folk Highschool, Vejle Idrætshøjskole, where you could register for the [short courses](http://vih.dk/kortekurser) and the [lectures](http://vih.dk/kortekurser). I wanted the users to be able to pay their registrations online, so I choose Drupal Commerce which support a lot of the needed goodies out of the box.

### Ditched the registration module

However, I needed some extra information about the registrants. First, I built the entire system using the [registration](http://drupal.org/project/registration) and [commerce\_registration](http://drupal.org/project/commerce_registration) module. However, each registrant needs an e-mail in those modules. A lot of my registrants are married couples, which share an e-mail, or children which does not have an e-mail.

### Used custom line items

So instead I chose to use some custom line items using the [commerce custom product](http://drupal.org/project/commerce_custom_product) module. I followed a screencast about [the module on commerceguys.com](http://commerceguys.com/blog/commerce-module-tuesday-commerce-customizable-products-screencast) and I setup the needed custom product types and custom line item types to cater for my needs. You can see the entire code at [github.com](http://github.com/vih/vih_short_course_commerce). By just doing that, I have a usable registration system, which is very easy to extend because it is just based on creating new product types and line item types. I also created some custom views to view the registrants, and I am planning on using [views\_send](http://drupal.org/project/views_send) to make it possible to e-mail my registrants at once and with an easy interface.

### Only allow the user to register for one item at a time

I altered the add to cart form a bit, so the registrant is only allowed to register for one item at a time. Each registration can have as many registrant as possible, but one registration can not have more courses or lectures. They have to start a new registration, if they want that. Inspired by [an article about a similar need](http://agileadam.com/add-to-cart-tweaks) I altered the add to form cart with the <a href="">code, you can find at our public github</a>.

### Heavily inspired my Commerce Kickstart

I still need to make some modifications to the flow - and I am heavily inspired by the really great [commerce kickstart distribution](http://drupal.org/project/commerce_kickstart). I still need to figure out:

- add the price on the product attribute, so the user do not have to wait for the ajax to do its magic. I was hoping that [this article](http://html-and-cms.com/blog/drupal-commerce-add-cart-form-alter-enabling-radio-titles-product-image-and-price) where I [revised the code slightly on this gist](https://gist.github.com/3884197), was the answer, but could not get it to work.
- how to have different flows depending on the product type in the cart - I have lectures and short course, but soon I will also have long courses.
- how to make the best backend for the system to make it really easy for our office to administer the registrations
