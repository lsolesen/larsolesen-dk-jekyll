There are a lot of websites offering the possibility to easily gather feedback from users. A lot of the websites have a priced plan, but [idea.informer.com](http://idea.informer.com) offers this service for free. I wanted to easily integrate that into my site, so I wrote a very basic and simple module, and I wanted to share it with the community, so we could improve it together. Read more about it on the [project page](http://drupal.org/project/ideainformer_widget), and feel free to open issues and create patches. It is still in an early alpha.

So far I have implemented it on [vih.dk](http://vih.dk), if you want to see it in action.
