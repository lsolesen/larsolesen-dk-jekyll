I spent a lot of time looking through various sites on the internet, before I found the easy solution on how to install PDT (PHP Development Tools) on Eclipse Galileo on my Ubuntu box. It was much easier than I first anticipated.

- First, install Eclipse via Synaptic. There is a packages.
- Second, make sure that you have the Galileo update site ([download.eclipse.org/releases/galileo](http://download.eclipse.org/releases/galileo)) present under Help | Install new software | Available update sites
- Third, go to Help | Install new software and choose the Galileo Update Site. Under Programming Languages you will find PDT. Just choose it and install.

See that was much easier, than I expected.
