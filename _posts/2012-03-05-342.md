I struggled with some minor stuff with Drupal 7, which I do not think I should be struggling with. However, I found some small modules which helped me solve the problems. I think these small modules should be a part of Drupal 8.

Reset password does not work at the moment
------------------------------------------

A site I am working on ([vih.dk](http://vih.dk)) had a user which could not remember her password. I asked her to use the Forgot Password option. She got her one-time login. However, after using that she could not change her password, as it requires her current password (there is a pending bug). Which she forgot. Not an easy situation. Luckily [password\_hustle](http://drupal.org/project/password_hustle) module would ask the user for a new password when using the one-time login. This is how you would expect everything to work in a mature cms, I think.

Shortcut module should be improved
----------------------------------

The toolbar is allright. I think many people tend to install other toolbars, and it does not have to be that way. Recently I thought I wanted to use [quickbar](http://drupal.org/project/quickbar) which is easier to customize per user role. However, I can get the same functionality with [shortcutperrole](http://drupal.org/project/shortcutperrole). After installing that I can easily customize the toolbar shortcuts for easier access to some menu items for the end user.

Make it easier to create links
------------------------------

It should be easier to create tabs, subtabs and action links without having to hardcode. I used [custom contexual links](http://drupal.org/project/ccl) to create some links there. I used [page manager](http://drupal.org/project/ctools) to create some local actions and some tabs. Shouldn't some of those things go into core in one easy to understand module?

So I am proposing to at least get these two small modules into Drupal 8 Core.
