Recently I switched to [mailchimp](http://mailchimp.com) for my newsletter needs for several reasons. I wanted an easy way to implement, and I read this article: [Mailchimp 2.0: Anatomy of a module rewrite](http://thinkshout.com/blog/2011/06/lev/mailchimp-20-anatomy-drupal-module-rewrite). I installed the [mailchimp module](http://drupal.org/project/mailchimp) and before thinking too clearly, I started looking at the code to see how I could create my own custom signup form which both logged-in and anonymous users could use to sign up for one of my lists.

I learned something about the anatomy of Drupal doing so, but really I should have read the article more in depth, because the answer was right there. Create a list and expose it as a _freeform_ and you will have the signup form in block you can just put in whereever you like. [See how I did it on vih.dk](http://vih.dk/nyhedsbrev).

This module made my life a whole lot easier.

What is missing?
----------------

- **Gives PHP notices.** Seems that there are some notices when having groups in the list. I [filed a bug](http://drupal.org/node/1208052).
- **Ways to alter the content of the block.** I cannot seem to find a way to alter the content of the block. I am not completely satisfied that it shows all the headlines making my own title obsolete. But that might be improved in later versions.
- **Translations.** As soon as the module reaches stable, I will translate missing strings myself. That is the beauty of Drupal :)
