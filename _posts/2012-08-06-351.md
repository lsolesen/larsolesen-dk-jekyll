Today I just released the alpha1-version of a very simple module, which makes integration with userreport.com possible. Introducing the module [userreport](http://drupal.org/project/userreport).

Userreports.com makes it possible to:

- conduct user surveys
- collect user feedback and information about bugs
- send demographic data to Google Analytics

It is a very simple module, which makes it easier to include the service without having to hack your template or open up for Full HTML in your blocks.

The code is only alpha quality, but wanted it released as quickly as possible, and I am already using it on a couple of live sites. Test, open issues, write patches, discuss.Do what the community does best.
