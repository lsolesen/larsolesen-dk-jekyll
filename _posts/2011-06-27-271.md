I was in love with [Scribd](http://scribd.com) for the following reasons:

- Nice possibilites for **embedding documents** into my own site.
- Good **api** for developers which I could use from within Drupal through [scribdfield](http://drupal.org/project/scribdfield).

That was why I suggested Scribd for [fjvu.dk](http://fjvu.dk/documents) for their document knowledge database. However, after finishing the development cycle and into the final phase of testing, the limitations started to show (note to self: remember to read all documentation before integrating an external service).

- The **upload limit was not sufficient** for my project. I had some documents on 200MB+, but Scribd cannot technically handle documents over 100MB (and in reality maybe only 75MB).
- To **download you need a Scribd account** even if the document has been embedded to another page. I did not want to force the users of fjvu.dk to create a Scribd account.

Everything taken into account, I had to drop Scribd and just upload the documents with a the Drupal file field (which does not give me the nice iPaper reader or any other eyecandy).

Unless any of you have a better suggestion?
