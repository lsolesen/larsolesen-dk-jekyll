I have created a e-commerce site using Drupal Commerce. The site is tied to a Google Analytics account through the [google analytics module](http://drupal.org/project/google_analytics) and the [commerce analytics module](http://drupal.org/project/commerce_google_analytics). To make the analysis more useful, I setup conversion goals for people going through the whole checkout process. Under Admin --> Profiles --> Goals I setup a goal: "Buying in the shop". I did the following:

**General information**

Goal name: Buying in the shop

Goal Type: URL destination

**Goal Details**

Goal URL: checkout/\[0-9\]+/complete

Match Type: Regular Expression Match

Goal value: 150 (as most of the products in my shop costs about 150 DKK)

**Goal funnel**

I also setup a goal funnel, so it was possible to see where I loose customers in the process.

Step 1: /checkout/\[0-9\]+

Step 2: /checkout/\[0-9\]+/shipping

Step 3: /checkout/\[0-9\]+/review

Step 4: /checkout/\[0-9\]+/payment

More to do?

I am currently looking into the following:

- I should probably create some custom reporting to make it easier to see how my goals convert.
- Should I create [other goals as this article suggests](http://www.cxfocus.com/index.php/set-up-google-analytics/goals-google-analytics/).
- Figure out how the the [commerce google analytics module actually works](http://drupal.org/project/commerce_google_analytics).

What goals are you setting up for your Drupal Commerce site? And how do you use the metrics in your daily life.
