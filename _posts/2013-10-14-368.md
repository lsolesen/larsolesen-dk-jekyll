My server is setup using Barracuda, and therefore running Aegir as a backend. For unknown reasons, I've experienced a couple of times that my database has been lost when having cloned a site. That meant I had my dev-site intact, but the production site database was lost.

First I edited the credentials for the dev site in the backend, both for the settings.php and the drushrc.php.

Then I edited /sites/domain.dk/drushrc.php and changed it with the database credentials from the development site.

Short after, I deleted ~/.drush/dev-alias.php and the site in the aegir frontend and manually deleted the site in the backend also.

By doing that this time, luckily, I lost less work that having to resolve to a day old backup.
