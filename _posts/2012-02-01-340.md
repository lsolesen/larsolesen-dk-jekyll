On Vejle Idrætshøjskoles site I needed to make pdf's of all the lectures, so I could create a small booklet. I created a lecture content type with a title, body and an image. I made a simple pdf of each lecture, but wanted to include a barcode, so people seeing the pdf could just scan it on their smartphones and go directly to the page and registration to participate in the lecture.

First I installed and enabled [chart](https://drupal.org/project/chart) and [libraries](https://drupal.org/project/libraries) and put the external PHP library [TCPDF](https://www.tcpdf.org/) in the libraries folder. Using TCPDF it is fairly easy to create a PDF, so I just needed to figure out how to use chart to create the barcode. So basically this is what I did.

```
$pdf = new TCPDF();

$chart = array(
  '#chart_id' => 'lectures_chart',
  '#type' => CHART_TYPE_QR,
  '#size' => chart_size(200, 200) 
);
        
$chart['#data'][] = '';
$chart['#labels'][] = $link;
        
$qr_file = chart_copy($chart, 'my_chart_' . uniqid(), '/home/username/www/sites/larsolesen.dk/files/charts/');
        
if ($qr_file !== false) {
  $pdf->Image($qr_file, 4, 250, 35, 0, '');
}
```

If you want to see the full approach on how I created this pdf, you can see my [small custom module on github](https://github.com/vih/vih_lectures_pdf).

There is many ways to improve the module, and it needs cleanup. However, it works, and you can easily include the barcode. Tweak it and try it (it is a custom module so it will not work directly on your website before changing it). Maybe you can even improve it?

P.S. To make the function chart\_copy() work in the above example, you need to apply the patch from [issue #1303706](https://drupal.org/node/1303706#comment-5092784).
