  <p>Thanks for this article!</p><p>I wondered what would happen to the installed modules. Due to the fact that in Drupal 6 you had to copy all module-files manually in the sites/all - folder to make them usable for all sites: This seem to be the standard in Drupal 7. All modules installed by the GUI are copied to sites/all/modules. Hence can be used by every page. Didn`t try that one out yet, but seems to be the case.</p>
