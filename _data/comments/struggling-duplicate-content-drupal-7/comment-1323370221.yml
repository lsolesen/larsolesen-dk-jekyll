  @Kars-T I have seen the possibility to add url-parameters in Google Webmaster Tools. However, I also care about Bing and other search engines. Therefore I think robots.txt is a better solution.

  @DVDB I also scheduled them for deletion in Google using Google Webmaster Tools. I would prefer not to use the metatag you suggested, as I wanted the other links to be indexed.
