  Thank you for sharing!

I'm trying to get shared folders working and wondering if you can help. I follwed instructions here: vagrantup.com/v1/docs/troubleshooting.html but when I try to update the Virtualbox Guest Additions with

sudo /etc/init.d/vboxadd setup

I get an error and need to specify KERN_DIR. Any ideas?
