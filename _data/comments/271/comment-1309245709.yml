  issuu.com has a awesome page flip book that expands to full view very nicely and makes the reading of documents a pleasure online. There are currently modules for d6 fo issuu https://drupal.org/project/issuu and https://drupal.org/project/smartlook.
  although you do have to register , you can just add one role that has rights to upload and assign those right to the users who need to use the upload
