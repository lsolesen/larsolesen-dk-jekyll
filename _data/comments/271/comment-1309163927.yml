  <p>&nbsp;In my company we use <a href="http://en.calameo.com/"><strong>Calameo </strong></a>as our defult document sharing service. Been very happy with it over the years. I can&#39;t confirm what the upload limit is, but I do know that our visitors can download our documents without needing a Calameo account of their own.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, I like the reader... But that&#39;s a personal preference already.</p><p>Best of luck</p>
