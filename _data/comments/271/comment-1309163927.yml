  In my company we use [**Calameo**](https://en.calameo.com/)as our defult document sharing service. Been very happy with it over the years. I can't confirm what the upload limit is, but I do know that our visitors can download our documents without needing a Calameo account of their own.

  Also, I like the reader... But that's a personal preference already.

  Best of luck
