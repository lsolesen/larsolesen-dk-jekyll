  <p>Great stuff, this is the way to go for abandoned or staled projects. Very nice iniative from you. If I have some time I will try to contribute - review some patches and etc. Actually what I&#39;m curious about is how to write tests. I&#39;ve never done that, seems to be kind of misterious, but maby it&#39;s actually not so hard. Will try to learn it. Any help links or videos would be appreciated. Thanks!</p>
