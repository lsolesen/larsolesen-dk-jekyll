  Great stuff, this is the way to go for abandoned or staled projects. Very nice iniative from you. If I have some time I will try to contribute - review some patches and etc. Actually what I'm curious about is how to write tests. I've never done that, seems to be kind of misterious, but maby it's actually not so hard. Will try to learn it. Any help links or videos would be appreciated. Thanks!
