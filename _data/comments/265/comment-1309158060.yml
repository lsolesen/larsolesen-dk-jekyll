  <p>With extra flexibility comes a hit in performance.</p><p>Larry Garfield did a write up a while ago about the cost of using call_user_func_array etc:<br />http://www.garfieldtech.com/blog/benchmarking-magic<br />that&#39;s well worth a read.</p><p>Other than the performance issues, are you suggesting that before <em>every</em> call to <code>l</code> I&#39;d need to do:</p>
<pre>
<code><?php
$GLOBALS["_global_function_handler_l"] = "drupal_function_handler_l";
$string = l("some text");
?></code></pre>
<p>Because that seems to be what that article is saying.</p><p>A great idea, but needs a better implementation, maybe using PHP namespaces?</p>
