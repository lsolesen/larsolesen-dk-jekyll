  With extra flexibility comes a hit in performance.

  Larry Garfield did a write up a while ago about the cost of using call\_user\_func\_array etc:
  https://www.garfieldtech.com/blog/benchmarking-magic
  that's well worth a read.

  Other than the performance issues, are you suggesting that before _every_ call to `l` I'd need to do:

  ```
  <?php $GLOBALS["_global_function_handler_l"] = "drupal_function_handler_l";
  $string = l("some text");
  ?>
  ```

  Because that seems to be what that article is saying.

  A great idea, but needs a better implementation, maybe using PHP namespaces?
