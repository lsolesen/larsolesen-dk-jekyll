  This seems like an inappropriate use of Drupal planet. If we allowed everyone to post asking for free advice/help upgrading their sites we would have dozens of posts like this per day.

  If you had tried to upgrade your site, documented the plan, documented the problems you ran into, and then posted all of that while asking for advice it would be a useful post but I don't see much value you are providing to the world here.
