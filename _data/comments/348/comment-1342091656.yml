  That's how linode is.

  Their support offers nothing more than dry answer, they don't negotiate, they don't move from their point of view, they are not flexible, they don't empathize with the customer.

  They generally offer a good product till now, they get stuck with that, and they don't offer any feeling of true customer care. Their support answers are as dry and as inflexible, as coming from a public service.

  They don't say that they may even consider it in the future or nothing like that.

  They are just technical guys, and don't know much about marketing and customer relations.

  The only solution to change this is to make a lot of users complain.

  They are driven by complains or competition, and not by market's signals.

  You sent them a signal (customer feedback), they ignored it. So, you just have to amplify it.

  There are few companies that are really gentle in their support and consider users' feedback seriously.

  You are right their backup is not good. Some days it may not even work, and you just get an email saying that for some reason backup did not work, and they ll investigate. But they don't offer automatic refund for it, if you don't ask.

  Their DNS service is also pretty basic.

  Generally they are relaxed because they offer a good VPS service, but their subservices are not something special. They seem not to care to about the subservices at all, because they are doing great with VPS core service.

  But they ignore the fact that like that they open a door to the customer to start investigating for alternatives.

  First you ll investigate for better backup, then better DNS. Like that the customer learns about new companies, like that the customer may go away in the future.

  Customer does not forget ignorance. The most important as a customer is to feel that they take care of your needs or at least consider and discuss them.

  Just informing the customer "that's how we are, we don't think we have to change, but you must change something" is a no-no for marketing.

  Good luck, and inform us about your solutions to the problem.

  Thanks for the article
