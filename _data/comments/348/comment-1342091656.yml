  <p>That&#39;s how linode is.</p><p>Their support offers nothing more than dry answer, they don&#39;t negotiate, they don&#39;t move from their point of view, they are not flexible, they don&#39;t empathize with the customer.</p><p>They generally offer a good product till now, they get stuck with that, and they don&#39;t offer any feeling of true customer care. Their support answers are as dry and as inflexible, as coming from a public service.</p><p>They don&#39;t say that they may even consider it in the future or nothing like that.</p><p>They are just technical guys, and don&#39;t know much about marketing and customer relations.</p><p>The only solution to change this is to make a lot of users complain.</p><p>They are driven by complains or competition, and not by market&#39;s signals.</p><p>You sent them a signal (customer feedback), they ignored it. So, you just have to amplify it.</p><p>There are few companies that are really gentle in their support and consider users&#39; feedback seriously.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You are right their backup is not good.&nbsp; Some days it may not even work, and you just get an email saying that for some reason backup did not work, and they ll investigate. But they don&#39;t offer automatic refund for it, if you don&#39;t ask.</p><p>Their DNS service is also pretty basic.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Generally they are relaxed because they offer a good VPS service, but their subservices are not something special. They seem not to care to about the subservices at all, because they are doing great with VPS core service.</p><p>But they ignore the fact that like that they open a door to the customer to start investigating for alternatives.</p><p>First you ll investigate for better backup, then better DNS. Like that the customer learns about new companies, like that the customer may go away in the future.</p><p>Customer does not forget ignorance. The most important as a customer is to feel that they take care of your needs or at least consider and discuss them.</p><p>Just informing the customer &quot;that&#39;s how we are, we don&#39;t think we have to change, but you must change something&quot; is a no-no for marketing.</p><p>Good luck, and inform us about your solutions to the problem.</p><p>Thanks for the article</p>
