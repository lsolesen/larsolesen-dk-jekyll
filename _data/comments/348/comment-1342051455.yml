  I really like Linode as well, but also find their backup service lacking. I use Aegir a little differently though. I run Aegir on a local dev server and push out to remote Linode hosts. My dev server is built on Turnkey Linux (Ubuntu) which features built in backup to Amazon S3. I also use Hosting Backup Queue. So Aegir uses hosting backup queue to backup the live sites to the dev server and then the whole dev server gets backed up to S3 and to a local source as well. While I haven't tried it, Barracuda should install on Turnkey Linux. While trickey, it is also possible to use your own images on Linode as well. I am not familiar with Barracuda's backup, how does that work? I have one Barracuda dev server running more as an expirement also.
