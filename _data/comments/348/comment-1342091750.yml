  Well $5 a month isn't much for keeping two backups. Keeping 7 daily backups would need 4 times the storage, I tried that on S3 but switched back to 1 daily backup when I saw how much it was costing me.

  Having said that, massive data loss sucks. I had a similar experience with Aegir a couple of years ago. Luckily it \*just\* deleted all the files on my production sites, and I could get them back from the daily backups. Haven't touched Aegir since.
