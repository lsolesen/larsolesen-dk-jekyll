  Thank you for your comment. It is probably a different project to make it a part of the WYSIWYG-module. An idea for a module would be media\_scribd. However, I have not had the time to see how the Media module has been put together yet. If you have any suggestions to the module, you are more than welcome to use the issue queue at [scribd\_filter](http://drupal.org/project/scribd_filter).
