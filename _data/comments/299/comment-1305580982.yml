  Hi,

  First of all a big thank you for the filter. It makes our life a hell lot easier. Love the way you can take up the wordpress embed code and use it with minimal modification. The HTML 5 feature is great too. Just a small enhacement which if possible would be great is integration into the WYSIWYG module so that it comes up as a button on the editor and even newbies can use it.

  Regards
