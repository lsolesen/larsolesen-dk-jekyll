  <p>Are you actively using this combination of fserver and appserver? &nbsp;I too am interested in using fserver to host the tar.gz or zip files that are served by appserver. It works, but it&#39;s cumbersome to add a new app or a new release. &nbsp;Creating some relationships between the fserver and app release entities would help. &nbsp;Let me know if you want to discuss this more. &nbsp;If you happen to be going to DrupalCon Denver, I&#39;ll be there.</p><p>Thanks for your write up!</p>
