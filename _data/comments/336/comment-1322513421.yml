  Would you be interested in writing up a README.txt for the appserver and contributing with a patch?

  Maybe just pull out the parts about how to set up the taxonomy and an app in the server and then how to access it from the apps module?

  http://drupal.org/node/1355132

  This is a good overview of how to set the two up for use.

  Also there is a group start at #drupal-apps to talk about and help out with apps.
