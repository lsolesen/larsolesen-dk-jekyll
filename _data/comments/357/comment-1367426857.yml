  When you say "First edit the Vagrantfile and put in an IP" how do you do this and what is the end result. Are you assigning a static IP for a bridged network?

Ideally I would have a static ip so my hosts file didn't need to be changed, but since my setup is on a laptop, I don't have a consistent network to work with.

I have looked into setting up a local dns server but it seems like more work than it might be worth.

For now my work network seems to keep giving me the same IP address using DHCP.
