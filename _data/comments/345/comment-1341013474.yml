I agree that people need to help getting patches into RTBC and that people have different schedules. However, for people to go digging through code and keeping their motivation to create patches, it is important to get feedback from the maintainers. Waiting months without response on your issues is probably to long to keep people engaged with your module. You will spend time on a module, because you need it. Waiting without response would probably make you look somewhere else - leaving the whole community worse off?</span></span></p><p><span rel="sioc:has_creator"><span class="username">I have asked to co-maintain media_gallery to get something committed, and luckily the <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1655160">maintainers responded quickly to that issue</a> :)</span></span></p>
