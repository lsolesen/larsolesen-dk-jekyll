  Everyone feels this way at some time - the problem is that your current sticking point is likely to be because you want to use this module NOW, but the maintainer may not have a pressing deadline etc. (quite simply, different people have different schedules).

  I'd agree that the best way is to progress the patch to RTBC.

  As a maintainer of a couple of modules, my spare time ebbs and flows, but when I have time, I always start by looking for RTBC patches to commit, then I review issues marked Needs Review, then Needs Work, before going for new work. I also prioritise bug reports over other tasks or features.
