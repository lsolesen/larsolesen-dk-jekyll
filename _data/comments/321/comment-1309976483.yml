  I have a D6 site running a forum and am using the Spam and CAPTCHA modules.

  People complain about the CAPTCHA module, even though I'm using the CSS CAPTCHA (it doesn't put up an image, it uses CSS to rearrange the order of a few characters, so it's easy to read and copy). I see a consistent number of failed CAPTCHA tests in my logs, so it does hurt usability.

  The Spam module mostly relies on a Bayesian filter, but I've created a number of whitelist custom filters, too. The Bayesian filter comes completely untrained, and it takes a fair amount of traffic for it to learn. I've been running my forum for a year and a half and I get about 5-10 new posts in a day (> 3000 messages). I would say that only now does the filter seem to be getting things right most of the time.

  Probably Mollom is a better solution and I will be looking at it the next time I revamp this site.
