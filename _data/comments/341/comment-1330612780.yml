  <p>Very comprehensive list. &nbsp;Not suggesting these be used but wanted to add these ideas / visuals to the list just to check out. &nbsp;These are some D6 UX concepts I&#39;ve baked into <a href="http://drupal.org/project/elms">ELMS</a> to help eliminate the Drupal usability gap.</p><p><a href="http://drupal.org/project/outline_designer">Outline Designer</a> -- Drag and Drop site outlines around structured in Books. &nbsp;Would be awesome to get this stuff working for menus / anything as a flexible UX. &nbsp;This has really gotten people behind drupal in higher education because of the ease of structuring material for courses / websites.</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psxpBvVkja0&amp;feature=plcp&amp;context=C30f8bbfUDOEgsToPDskIrTgNCVHxPCFYWyWr9j_yo">ELMS Wrapper User Interface</a> -- Admin centric design is great but I think there are A LOT more content authors / managers / admin-lite accounts out there that don&#39;t have full access to. &nbsp;This abstracts the tabs and pages that people need to get to from the rest of the system so that the content is purely the content. &nbsp;Contextual inline stuff is great for those of us that can think about content that way, I&#39;ve been getting a lot of positive feedback from more of the content author crowd around things looking exactly like they are +/- the offset wrapper UI.</p><p><a href="http://drupal.org/project/requirement_dashboard">Requirement Dashboard</a> -- This allows for the definition of pages that mimic the drupal system status page. &nbsp;This way you can give content authors / managers / admin-lite users access to &quot;heads up display&quot; kind of overview information without giving them access to the full admin info. &nbsp;This <a href="https://drupal.psu.edu/blog/356">video shows some earlier work</a> on its implementation throughout ELMS to construct lite-system and organic group specific dashboards.</p>
