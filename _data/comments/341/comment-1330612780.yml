  Very comprehensive list. Not suggesting these be used but wanted to add these ideas / visuals to the list just to check out. These are some D6 UX concepts I've baked into [ELMS](http://drupal.org/project/elms) to help eliminate the Drupal usability gap.

  [Outline Designer](http://drupal.org/project/outline_designer) -- Drag and Drop site outlines around structured in Books. Would be awesome to get this stuff working for menus / anything as a flexible UX. This has really gotten people behind drupal in higher education because of the ease of structuring material for courses / websites.

  [ELMS Wrapper User Interface](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psxpBvVkja0&feature=plcp&context=C30f8bbfUDOEgsToPDskIrTgNCVHxPCFYWyWr9j_yo) -- Admin centric design is great but I think there are A LOT more content authors / managers / admin-lite accounts out there that don't have full access to. This abstracts the tabs and pages that people need to get to from the rest of the system so that the content is purely the content. Contextual inline stuff is great for those of us that can think about content that way, I've been getting a lot of positive feedback from more of the content author crowd around things looking exactly like they are +/- the offset wrapper UI.

  [Requirement Dashboard](http://drupal.org/project/requirement_dashboard) -- This allows for the definition of pages that mimic the drupal system status page. This way you can give content authors / managers / admin-lite users access to "heads up display" kind of overview information without giving them access to the full admin info. This [video shows some earlier work](https://drupal.psu.edu/blog/356) on its implementation throughout ELMS to construct lite-system and organic group specific dashboards.
