  I wanted a ready to use media gallery. Now I am involved in getting it to work with the 2.x-version when I got the time. Btw there is a [patch which needs testing](http://drupal.org/node/1391332) :)

  I do not have the same impression as you on Drupal 7 modules. I have only used Drupal 6 a bit, but I think Drupal 7 is a leap forward. Which 'basic modules' do you think are lacking for you to move to Drupal 7?
