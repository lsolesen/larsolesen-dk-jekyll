  <p>Responding to the question &quot;How to write an Essay in English,&quot; it should be remembered that any essay consists of several parts. I identified the introduction three most important, main part and conclusion. The introduction should describe the key idea, idea or problem you will be talking about in the main part. Best of all, if it sounds like some brief but concise full statements. Moreover, it could be a quote in English, if you can pick it up in accordance with the semantic content of the<br />English essay.<br />The main part of the English essay the right to present arguments prove or disprove your main thoughts that have expressed your personal opinion on the issue.<br />Finally, complete all your arguments and draw conclusions, which will be the last part of your essay in English.</p>
