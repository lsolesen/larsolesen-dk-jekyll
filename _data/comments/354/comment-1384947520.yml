  Hi - interesting post. I also develop a Drupal Commerce website which is selling courses and so on, and have grappled with the issue of managing course dates and so in line items.

  I haven't tried out the entity reference route you've described, but I have a question:

  What happens when a course has to be removed from the line item options? Does this have an impact upon previous orders on the system (which reference those options)?
