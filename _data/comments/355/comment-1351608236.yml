  So, you ask if the issue is resolved, and then close the issue if no one responds in 14 days? That seems rather cruel and disrespectful to me.

  If the issue description has enough detail for you to reproduce it, then you owe it to the reporter to TEST the issue before you suggest that it might be resolved.

  If you're too lazy to test the report for yourself, then you aren't "cleaning" the issue queue, you are vandalizing it.

  I know I'm going over the top here, and I suspect that the vast majority of your actions are totally justified! But your process as described is too disruptive.

  If there isn't enough information to test the issue against dev or the latest release, then by all means go ahead!
