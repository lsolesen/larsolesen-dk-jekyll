  Thanks for all of your work in the issue queues! I'm sure the module maintainers appreciate it. Hopefully, other users will follow your lead and also start to help keep things in order.

  I think that you have some good ideas about automating some issue queue activity, but it would have to be done with caution. I think it would be a good idea to close "maintainer needs more info" issues after 1~3 months of no activity, but auto-promoting old issues might create unnecessary noise not desired by module maintainers. Some issue queues are quire large -- Drush has nearly 600 open issues right now. That could lead to a fairly steady stream of old issues getting promoted back to the top of the list. If no one has touched an issue in a long time, perhaps it is not a very important issue, and doesn't need to be promoted. On the other hand, if the automated system also set the status of these old issues to "maintainer needs more info", then perhaps it would be easier to filter these old issues out when dealing with new reports. With this addition, automated promotion might be a useful thing to have.
