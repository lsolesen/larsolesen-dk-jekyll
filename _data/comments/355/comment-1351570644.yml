  <p>Thanks for all of your work in the issue queues! &nbsp;I&#39;m sure the module maintainers appreciate it. &nbsp;Hopefully, other users will follow your lead and also start to help keep things in order.</p><p>I think that you have some good ideas about automating some issue queue activity, but it would have to be done with caution. &nbsp;I think it would be a good idea to close &quot;maintainer needs more info&quot; issues after 1~3 months of no activity, but auto-promoting old issues might create unnecessary noise not desired by module maintainers. &nbsp;Some issue queues are quire large &nbsp;-- Drush has nearly 600 open issues right now. That could lead to a fairly steady stream of old issues getting promoted back to the top of the list. &nbsp;If no one has touched an issue in a long time, perhaps it is not a very important issue, and doesn&#39;t need to be promoted. On the other hand, if the automated system also set the status of these old issues to &quot;maintainer needs more info&quot;, then perhaps it would be easier to filter these old issues out when dealing with new reports. With this addition, automated promotion might be a useful thing to have.</p>
