  <p>I&#39;d be very wary of doing this automatically, particularly the &quot;is this still a problem in the current version&quot; question. From the bug reporter&#39;s point of view such an email is a reminder that work is being done on the module, but there bug isn&#39;t important enough to be fixed. It might be true, but it&#39;s not a very friendly message to send!</p>
