  Thanks for all the comments. Actually they made me reconsider whether to do a 404. At first, I really did not want to spend time maintaining the links and just rely on Google to discover the new pages and eventually they will rank as high as the old pages. However, I think I will spend a couple of hours and make the redirects properly. I will consider the redirect module for that.
