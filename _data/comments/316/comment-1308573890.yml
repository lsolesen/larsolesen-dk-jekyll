  <p>The redirect module (http://drupal.org/project/redirect) is probably the best way to handle this in Drupal 7. &nbsp;It allows you to create redirects with 3xx codes (301, etc), which will let Google know that the content has moved. &nbsp;From what I understand, using a 404 essentially throws away any SEO value you had from that page, so I would use a 301 to redirect to a relevant page. &nbsp;Nice tip on using page manager response codes though. &nbsp;</p>
