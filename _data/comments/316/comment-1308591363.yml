  I'd (almost) never 404 them, as that could possibly destroy the backlink juice you have on those pages.

  I'd 301 them to the new location, or to a page that has 'sort of' the same content if it's not moved 1:1.

  This way Google (in time) will delete old urls from the index, you still have the backlink power, and you'll give your users the best possible user experience.

  Even when the 'old' urls are deleted from Google's index, there may still be links on blogs/forums/bookmarks/social sites. Giving those users a good experience is key, and keeping your backlink juice is also important for ranking.
