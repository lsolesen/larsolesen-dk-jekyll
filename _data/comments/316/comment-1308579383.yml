  <p>We used the Redirect module (http://drupal.org/project/redirect) to add 301 redirects from our old links to the new ones, this has the benefit of not making those pages &#39;dead&#39; for a user that follows a link to them, in fact they probably don&#39;t even notice they&#39;ve been redirected.</p>
